Routes.razor

Purpose: Blazor router configuration for the application
Handles URL routing and navigation between pages

Features:
- Routes to pages with @page directives
- Applies default layout to all pages
- Manages focus for accessibility on navigation
- Redirects unknown routes to homepage (via Program.cs fallback)

How it works:
1. Router scans Program.Assembly for components with @page directive
2. When route matches, displays component in RouteView
3. FocusOnNavigate improves accessibility by focusing first h1

@* Router component: Scans assembly for @page directives and handles navigation *@
<Router AppAssembly="typeof(Program).Assembly">
    @* Found: Executes when a matching route is found *@
    <Found Context="routeData">
        @* RouteView: Renders the matched page component
            - RouteData: Contains matched component and parameters
            - DefaultLayout: Wraps page in MainLayout.razor
        *@
        <RouteView RouteData="routeData" DefaultLayout="typeof(Layout.MainLayout)" />

        @* FocusOnNavigate: Accessibility feature
            - Automatically focuses the first h1 element after navigation
            - Helps screen readers announce page changes
            - Improves keyboard navigation experience

        <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="routeData" Selector="h1" />
